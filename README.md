# Overview
Automatically upload assignments and avoid deadlines for UMT SKT ðŸ™‚ <br>

If one student uploads an assignment it will be downloaded parapharsed and uploaded to all student accounts, I'm basically making this because of my procrastination I didn't submit any assignment on time, and I had to face the consequences in exam results :(


<h2> Dependencies </h2>
Python3,
Selenium,
Google Chrome,
WebDriver for Chrome,
beautifulSoup4
